SONG: “A NOT SO TERRIBLE PARABLE”

verse 1 
It was a dark and stormy night
A man lay beaten by the side of the road
As two travelers pass him by
But the third one stopped, had pity on him
Bandaged his wounds and took him to an inn
That’s the story of the Good Samaritan

chorus
Mercy and love were on display
The life of a wounded man was saved
This story for the ages, as you will see
Brings a message of hope for you and me
It’s a not so terrible parable
A not so terrible parable

	Dialog (begins at meas. 39)

ALISTAIR:	Welcome to Master’s Peace Theater, I’m your host Alistair McAlister. Two-thousand years ago, a rich young lawyer asked Jesus the question, “How do I get eternal life?” The answer? Love the Lord your God, and love your neighbor as yourself. Then the lawyer asked Jesus, “Who is my neighbor?” Instead of answering that question, Jesus told a fascinating story filled with mystery … danger … surprise … and truth!

SONG: “A NOT SO TERRIBLE PARABLE”

bridge
Love for your neighbor, we see
Grace for the one in need
And you better believe from beginning to end
There’s more to the story of the Good Samaritan

chorus
Mercy and love were on display
The life of a wounded man was saved
This story for the ages, as you will see
Brings a message of hope for you and me
It’s a not so terrible parable
A not so terrible parable

SCENE 1:

(The guests and employees, minus Binder and Barrister, enter the living room of the Inn, quietly talking among themselves. It’s a relaxing evening, though a terrible storm is raging outside. Alistair speaks to the audience, as he always will do.)

ALISTAIR:     	At the quaint Mountain Vista Inn, on a dark and stormy night, long ago in 1939, guests are assembling in the drawing room for a quiet dinner to follow. However, the evening will be anything but quiet! 

	 SoundFX: “Doorbell”

(The front door bell rings, catching everyone’s attention. All run to the door, but dramatically stop short in fear. Jeeves finally goes to the door, bravely, and opens it. As he does, Guy Random, standing on the other side, falls into the room as if he was a board propped up against the door. All gasp or scream, then FREEZE.)

ALL:	(all gasp)

ALISTAIR: 	An injured man mysteriously appears on the doorstep. Who is he? What happened to him? What does it all mean? You may be shocked … you may be amazed … you may laugh out loud. But you’ll not soon forget, as Master’s Peace Theater presents A Not So Terrible Parable!

	 SoundFX: “Suspense Accent”

DESCRIPTION: (The guests UNFREEZE and revive Guy and help him to a couch. They stand on each side of the couch, as Guy Random sits alone in the middle of the couch. All are looking at each other, but Guy Random is staring straight ahead toward the audience. He checks his pockets as Alistair introduces him.)

ALISTAIR:	The man? A real estate investor. His name? Guy Random. A guest of the Inn who left earlier that day, planning to use the money he carried to buy property in the nearby town of Simpleville.

DESCRIPTION: (Guy begins to become more lucid as the guests and employees attempt to revive him. All sit on the couch next to Random, except Grace, the only one who remains standing.)

YVETTE:	Oh no! Who is it?

GRACE:	Yvette! This is one of our guests, Mr. Random!

DESCRIPTION: (As Alistair introduces Grace, she looks toward the audience and preens, enjoying the introduction.)

ALISTAIR:	The proprietor of the century-old, gracious Mountain Vista Inn is Mrs. Grace S. Mountain-Vista, a pillar of the community. She cares for her guests and caters only to the crème-de-la-crème of clients. 

DESCRIPTION: (As Jeeves is speaking the next line, he stands and Grace sits.)

JEEVES:	It’s him alright! He left this morning to look at some property he wanted to buy! He had a lot of money with him, as I remember! 

DESCRIPTION: (As Alistair begins to speak, Jeeves looks toward the audience. Jeeves can straighten his jacket or vest or tie as he’s introduced.)

ALISTAIR:	Nothing gets past Jeeves, the butler. If Mrs. Mountain-Vista is the heart and soul of the Inn, Jeeves is the motor that makes it run smoothly.

DESCRIPTION: (During the next interactions, Jeeves sits and Yvette stands.)

RANDOM:	The last thing I remember was getting on the toll road to Simpleville.

JEEVES:	Are you alright? 

RANDOM:	I’ll be okay, I guess. (pats his pants and coat) But … my money is gone! ALL of it!

	 SoundFX: “Suspense Accent”

YVETTE:	Oh no! You were robbed and beaten!

GRACE:	Do you need a doctor?

RANDOM:	(looking at himself and realizing with surprise that he’s already bandaged) Well, I’d say I would, but it appears that I’ve already been treated and bandaged!

YVETTE:	Oh no! You were robbed and beaten by a doctor!

ALISTAIR:	If Jeeves is the brains of the Mountain Vista Inn, Yvette the maid (searching for a description) … isn’t. But as everyone knows, no mystery can be told without a maid and a butler. 

GRACE:	No, Yvette. Doctors don’t rob and beat people. Robbers do!

YVETTE:	Of course! “Robbers.” The name should have given it away.

GRACE:	Clearly, Mr. Random was in no condition to get back to the Inn by himself, so somebody must have bandaged his wounds and brought him here.

RANDOM:	(finding an envelope in his pocket) Look! An envelope! This wasn’t there when I left. There’s writing on it! (reading the writing on the outside of the envelope) “Please take care of this man, I found him on the road to Simpleville. This should cover it for now. If you need more, I’ll give it to you.”

DESCRIPTION: (Random then opens the envelope, and is surprised by its contents. He hands the envelope to Jeeves.)

JEEVES:	There’s almost a hundred dollars in here! Who gave this to you?

YVETTE:	Who brought you here?

RANDOM:	I have no idea. I remember nothing!

	 SoundFX: “Suspense Accent”

YVETTE:	That’s … that’s TERRIBLE!

DESCRIPTION: (Yvette puts her forearm up and faints backwards into Jeeves’ arms.)

ALISTAIR:	Oh. And Yvette is a little … dramatic.

JEEVES:	(from the floor, reviving Yvette) No other clues?

RANDOM:	The only thing I’ve still got is my watch. (looks at the pocket watch) And it looks like it’s been stepped on. That’s probably why they didn’t take it.

	 SoundFX: “Doorbell”

DESCRIPTION: (Everybody turns melodramatically to look at the door as Grace walks over and opens the door somewhat fearfully. Ricki Blaine makes a grand entrance.)

ALL:	(dramatically) RICKI BLAINE!

BLAINE:	In the flesh!

DESCRIPTION: (As Alistair introduces Blaine, she stares dashingly at the audience, flamboyantly pulling out a small pad and pen from her trench coat to write down clues.)

ALISTAIR:	Yes, Ricki Blaine! The most famous detective in the world. No case too big, no cause too small!

GRACE:	What brings a famous Private Detective out here on a night like this, Ms. Blaine?

BLAINE:	I’ve been brought in to solve this case for the Simpleville City Toll Road and I’ve come to see your Mr. Random. 

JEEVES:	But Mr. Random doesn’t remember a thing! 

BLAINE:	We’ll see about that. What about your other guests? 

YVETTE:	I’m not sure we can be of any service, detective. All of our guests were in the house all evening.

BLAINE:	All of ’em?

GRACE: 	Well, except the lawyer Jenny Barrister, and the door-to-door Bible seller, Brooks Binder. They’re checking in later tonight. 

DESCRIPTION: (As Grace says the words, the front door swings open and both Binder and Barrister come in from the terrible storm outside.)

BINDER:	Whew! What a terrible storm!

BARRISTER:	Just about blew my Packard off the road!

BLAINE:	Well, well. It looks like the gang’s all here! Why don’t you all take a seat.

SONG:	(music begins to “Whodunit?”)

BLAINE:	Nobody leaves this room until we find out … whodunit!

SONG: “WHODUNIT?”

chorus 1 
Whodunit? 
Let’s hear the confession
Who helped the wounded man on the street?
Whodunit?
What’s your suggestion?
We’re not sure who it could be
Step forward, now is the time to admit
Answer the question, and the question is
Whodunit? 

DESCRIPTION: Dialog (begins meas. 24)

BARRISTER:		Surely you don’t consider me a suspect, do you detective?

BLAINE:		Maybe, maybe not. 

BARRISTER:		You know I’d never hurt someone like that!

BLAINE:	I do believe you, Barrister. But … where were you on the night of the crime?

BARRISTER:		Well, it happened tonight, and … I’m right here.

BLAINE:	Oh … yeah! Point one for you, Barrister! But I think there’s more to this mystery. I’ve got more questions for you.

SONG: "WHODUNIT?"

chorus 2
Whodunit? 
Why the discretion?
Who helped the wounded man on the street?
Whodunit?
They left an impression
We’re not sure who it could be
Step forward, now is the time to admit
Answer the question, and the question is
Whodunit? 

DESCRIPTION:	Dialog (begins meas. 55)

BLAINE:	You got anything you wanna tell me, Binder?

BINDER:		I don’t have any idea what you’re talking about!

BLAINE:		You afraid I’ll throw the book at you?

BINDER:	Not at all. Books are my business! You know I wouldn’t do 
	such a horrible thing like that to anyone.

BLAINE:		I think I believe you, Binder.

JEEVES:		Do you think the robbers knew he had all that money?

BLAINE:		Not sure. He might just have been …

YVETTE:	(interrupting with a joke she’s obviously been waiting a long time to use) … a random victim?!

SONG: "WHODUNIT?"

bridge
Just a little more understanding
Could help find someone outstanding
Who is the neighbor that came to the rescue?
We need the whole truth and nothing but the truth

tag
Step forward, now is the time to admit
Answer the question, and the question is
Whodunit?

SCENE 2:

ALISTAIR:	Well, well, the plot thickens! Who came to the aid of the poor injured man? Is the person who saved Mr. Random in the room? What about the robbers? Oh my, I can’t wait! Let’s get back to our story!

DESCRIPTION: (Another doorbell ring startles the cast and Jeeves starts toward the door.)

	 SoundFX: “Doorbell”

JEEVES:	My turn.

DESCRIPTION: (Jeeves opens the door with some trepidation, and Samantha enters carrying a pizza box.)

GRACE:	Samantha Ayrton! It’s the delivery girl from Pizzapalooza in Simpleville!

SAMANTHA:	(looking at a slip of paper) Someone order a pepperoni, onion and strawberry jam pizza?

DESCRIPTION: (Everybody grimaces and looks at each other. Nobody remembers ordering a pizza.)

ALL: 	“Not me!” “Nope!” “No Way,” etc.

RANDOM:	That unusual smell … it’s familiar. 

SAMANTHA:	(looking at her order sheet) That’s strange, they usually don’t get the address wrong. 

GRACE:	Even if there was a mix-up, I’m just glad you’re here—we need food! The power just came back on and I haven’t been able to cook! 

DESCRIPTION:	(Jeeves takes the pizza from Samantha.)

JEEVES:	It’s cold!

SAMANTHA:	(seems to be hiding something) Oh … uh … well … I had a long drive.

YVETTE:	But it’s not that far to Simpleville!

SAMANTHA:	It’s been a longer trip than usual tonight, trust me. (leaving) Well, have a good night!

DESCRIPTION:	(Samantha bops out the front door and exits.)

GRACE:	(suspiciously) She seemed in quite a hurry to leave … 

JEEVES:	And the pizza was cold … as if she was doing something else … like robbing!	

BLAINE:	Not now, Jeeves. Alright, spill it, Barrister! What happened tonight?

BARRISTER:	You’re the detective, Blaine. You tell me!

BLAINE:	Very well. Lucky for me, I brought along my Flashback Set. Bring it in!

DESCRIPTION: (Yvette and Jeeves carry in the Flashback Set, a small backdrop in front of which a “doubled cast” pantomimes the described action in the next sequence. As the set is coming in, the doubled Guy Random lays down in front of the set.)

GRACE:	Flashback Set?

RANDOM:	What’s a Flashback Set?

BLAINE:	What’s a Flashback Set? It’s the latest thing! Everybody is so visual today. You can’t just tell a story anymore without show and tell!

GRACE:	How does it work? 

BLAINE:	I tell the story of what happened, and the flashback artists act it out so you can understand the facts!

	 SoundFX: “Flashback Set”

DESCRIPTION: (Flashback artists wave at the others. At this point, the pantomime cast, Guy #2 and Barrister #2, comes to the set and perfectly, if overly dramatically, pantomime Barrister #1’s story.)

BLAINE:	Okay, Barrister, you were driving up here from Simpleville on the toll road. You saw Mr. Random lying on the road!

(Barrister #2 runs up and checks the man. She’s walking in “rain” under an umbrella.)

BLAINE:	“Maybe,” you thought, “he fell out of an ambulance! Maybe he needs a lawyer!”

BARRISTER:	No!

BLAINE:	Yes! You thought about helping him but then, you wondered if it might be a trap. The crooks might be just over the hill, ya figured!

DESCRIPTION:	(Barrister #2 looks fearfully around, afraid of being robbed.)

BLAINE:	You wanted to leave, but you needed to know if that was legal. So you checked in your Big Book of Laws!

DESCRIPTION: (Barrister #2 has a brainstorm, then opens the Big Book of Laws—and has to put down her umbrella to do so. She sees something important, shows excitement, slams the book closed, picks up her umbrella and walks away smugly.)

BLAINE:	And that’s when you left him in the mud. But, you see, Barrister, I matched your tire tracks.

BARRISTER:	So?

RANDOM:	It’s coming back to me! Somebody checked on me, then drove away on the other side of the road. Big car! A Packard. Just like the one …

BLAINE:	Ms. Barrister drives? 

	 SoundFX: “Suspense Accent”

BLAINE:	So, you may not have been one of the robbers, Barrister, but it appears that instead of helping the wounded Mr. Random, you hightailed it outta there!

DESCRIPTION:	(Blaine gives a “ta da” gesture to the flashback scene. The flashback actors all bow, and quickly carry the flashback set offstage; one of them hand the Big Book of Laws to Yvette before they go. Blaine continues talking to the other characters as they pack up and exit.)

BARRISTER:	Nice story, detective, but the law is based on evidence, and you’ve got no evidence!

BLAINE:	Don’t I? Yvette, bring out Ms. Barrister’s Big Book of Laws!

DESCRIPTION:	(Barrister begins to look fearful as Yvette brings over the Book, which is dry.)

BARRISTER:	See? Just what I was tellin’ ya! Dry as a bone! If I was using it in the rain it would be soaked.

BLAINE:	(dramatically opening the book) Except for the page where you looked up “Who Is My Neighbor?” And that page is soaking wet!

ALL:	(all gasp)

YVETTE:	This is terrible!

DESCRIPTION: (Yvette puts her forearm up again and faints backwards into Jeeves’ arms.)

BARRISTER:	(politely) Is she gonna be okay? That’s like the third time.

JEEVES:	Happens a lot. Please go on with your tirade.

BARRISTER:	(sweetly) Thank you. (then to Blaine, angrily) Listen copper, I’m not taking the fall for this! I know the law! I didn’t lay a finger on this man. Sure, I gotta love my neighbor! But this guy was just some palooka. If the law doesn’t say that I have to, why should I stick my neck out for him?

BLAINE:	Ah, that is a very good question! Why would we stick out our neck … or lay down our life … for somebody else?

SONG: “BECAUSE HE FIRST LOVED US”

chorus
We love because He first loved us
He showed us fully when He sent His Son
The greatest gift is ours to share
With anyone, any time, anywhere
Yes, we love because He first loved us
We love because He first loved us

verse 1 
This is how we know what love is, love is
Jesus laid down His life for us
To whoever’s in need, what can we give? We’ll give
All we can to share His love 
We can share the love of Jesus 

chorus
We love because He first loved us
He showed us fully when He sent His Son
The greatest gift is ours to share
With anyone, any time, anywhere
Yes, we love because He first loved us
We love because He first loved us

verse 2
This is how we know what love is, love is
Patient and kind to everyone
To whoever’s in need, what can we give? We’ll give
A love that hopes and a love that trusts
We can share the love of Jesus

chorus
We love because He first loved us
He showed us fully when He sent His Son
The greatest gift is ours to share
With anyone, any time, anywhere
Yes, we love because He first loved us
We love because He first loved us

bridge
“And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love.
Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them. … 
We love because He first loved us.” 1 John 4:16 & 19
We can share the love of Jesus

chorus
We love because He first loved us
He showed us fully when He sent His Son
The greatest gift is ours to share
With anyone, any time, anywhere
Yes, we love because He first loved us
We love because He first loved us
We love because He first loved us
We love because He first loved us

SCENE 3:

ALISTAIR:	Oh my! This is getting interesting! Well, if Ms. Barrister wasn’t the robber, and she didn’t save Guy Random, that appears to leave only one suspect; Brooks Binder, the door-to-door Bible seller. If someone who makes his living with the Bible wouldn’t save a poor, injured victim, who would? And if he didn’t, why not?

DESCRIPTION:	(The doorbell rings again.)

	 SoundFX: “Doorbell”

YVETTE:	Who could that be on a night like this?

DESCRIPTION:	(Blaine answers the door; again, it’s Samantha.)

BLAINE:	Ah ha! It’s Miss Samantha, with the pizza, in the doorway!

RANDOM:	What are you doing here? Again.

SAMANTHA:	I guess I should be asking you people. Someone ordered a large anchovy and liver pizza. 

RANDOM:	That’s horrible!

SAMANTHA:	You’re telling me! I don’t have time for prank orders!

RANDOM:	No, I meant the pizza. Who would order anchovy and liver?

ALL:	Ew!

SAMANTHA:	Let me guess. Nobody ordered it. But just keep it. Nobody else would want it. Night.

DESCRIPTION:	(Samantha bops out again, exiting.)

RANDOM:	That smell is familiar …

BLAINE:	Brooks Binder, I’ve got a few questions for you. I’m gonna cut right to the last chapter.

BINDER:	You lookin’ for a revelation?

BLAINE:	Don’t play hardback with me, Binder! I’m lookin’ for answers! You sell Books, Brooks?

BINDER:	Bibles, Blaine.

BLAINE:	Bibles? I guess that makes you an expert on what’s in them.

BINDER:	I know everything there is to know about Bibles. Ours come with an eternal guarantee. They’re bound only in the finest quality genuine imitation leather.

BLAINE:	Expensive?

BINDER:	Imitation cows aren’t cheap. 

BLAINE:	I get what’s on the outside, but whaddaya know about what’s between the covers?

BINDER:	I know everything! We use the finest thin paper and all the words of Jesus are printed in deluxe imported red ink.

BLAINE:	Okay then, what does that Bible say about helping people in need?

BINDER:	It probably talks about that, but I’m helping people every day. I’m selling Bibles to people in need. And if you’re poor, I throw in the red ink for free.

RANDOM:	Hold it. Another familiar smell. (Random grabs a Bible from Binder) I remember smelling imitation leather! He must be the one who saved me!

BLAINE:	Maybe, maybe not. You’re an open book to me, Binder. Bring out my Flashback Set!

	 SoundFX: “Flashback Set”

DESCRIPTION: (The flashback artists again bring out the Flashback Set—this time more quickly. They set it up and Guy #2 and Brooks Binder #2 act out the scene, miming the action described below. Guy #2 lays in front of the flashback set. Binder #2 mimes driving past.)

BLAINE:	You were driving along and you saw something in the road. 
	
DESCRIPTION:	(Binder #2 “stops” his “car,” opening the “door,” he walks out.)	
	
BLAINE:		You got out of your car and walked toward the man. 
	
DESCRIPTION:	(Binder #2 looks closely at the prone Guy #2.)
	
BLAINE:		You didn’t recognize him as one of your customers, so you went back to your car. 
	
DESCRIPTION:	(Binder #2 turns to return to his “car,” but his foot gets “stuck.” He tries to unstick it during the following lines.)
	
BLAINE:		But when you did, your foot got stuck in the mud!

BINDER:	I’m not spineless, Blaine! You’re writing fiction! 

BLAINE:	I’m writing nothing. You already wrote chapter and verse! Whoever walked away from Random stuck their foot in the mud and when they pulled it out, the bottom of their left shoe came off!

DESCRIPTION:	(Binder #2 finally pulls his foot free and hands his left shoe to Blaine. Blaine holds it up, giving the same “ta da” gesture as before. Binder #2 and Guy #2 bow, and quickly exit with the flashback set, as the scene continues.)
	
JEEVES:	You don’t mean?

BLAINE:	Yes! Whoever left Mr. Random in the mud lost his sole! (holds out the muddy shoe) 

BINDER: 	You saying I have no soul?

YVETTE: 	(aside) Well, if the shoe fits …

DESCRIPTION:	(Binder begins to walk away, but his walk is uneven.)

BLAINE:	Not so fast! Take a look at your left shoe, Binder.

(Blaine walks over and pulls up the cuffs of the pants. Binder sheepishly hands him his left shoe.)

BLAINE:	Just as I thought, your left shoe has no sole.

	 SoundFX: “Suspense Accent”

YVETTE:	Ohhhh! 

DESCRIPTION: (Yvette begins to dramatically faint once again, but notices that Jeeves isn’t there to catch her. She immediately stands up straight, and with a disgruntled “Hmph!”, walks over to a chair and promptly faints onto the chair. The rest of the group looks at Jeeves disapprovingly, as if to say, “Where were you?”)


JEEVES:	Hey, I can’t be there all the time! She’s supposed to yell “It’s 
	terrible” first!

BLAINE:	So, what about loving and helping your neighbor, Binder?

BINDER: 	(panicked, the jig is up) It’s not my fault! He was muddy! Can you imagine getting mud all over new Bibles? No one will buy a muddy Bible. Besides, he’s not my neighbor—I’d never seen him before!

BLAINE:	Ya just don’t get it do ya, Brooks?

BINDER:	What?

BLAINE:	It seems that you spend a lot of time with the Bible, but maybe not enough time in the Bible. Or better yet, letting the truth of God’s Word get from here (points at the Bible) into here! (puts hand over heart)

SONG: “YOUR WORD IS ALIVE”

verse 1 
In Your Word I find truth 
Throughout I find You 
Your faithful, steady hand 
In Your Word I find love 
And I’m overcome 
By Your pursuit of all of us 
I’m thankful because 

chorus
Your Word is alive 
It’s changing me from the inside 
How I live, how I think, I believe 
Your Word is alive 
My light, my life 
Your truth will be my guide 
I’ll follow every day 
Your Word is alive, whoa, oh, oh 
Your Word is alive, whoa, oh, oh 
Your Word is alive 

verse 2
In Your Word I find power 
You are my strong tower 
I’ll never be alone 
In Your Word I find Your Son 
He is the Saving One 
The sacrifice for us 
I’m thankful because 

chorus
Your Word is alive 
It’s changing me from the inside 
How I live, how I think, I believe 
Your Word is alive 
My light, my life 
Your truth will be my guide 
I’ll follow every day 
I’ll never be the same 

chorus
Your Word is alive 
It’s changing me from the inside 
How I live, how I think, I believe 
Your Word is alive 
My light, my life 
Your truth will be my guide 
I’ll follow every day 
Your Word is alive, whoa, oh, oh 
Your Word is alive, whoa, oh, oh 
Your Word is alive, whoa, oh, oh 
Your Word is alive, whoa, oh, oh 
Your Word is alive

SCENE 4:

ALISTAIR:	Well, it would seem that we are in a conundrum. I don’t exactly know what that is, but I believe we are in it. We know now that neither Barrister nor Binder saved Guy Random. And neither of them was involved with the robbers. Everyone else has an alibi. Or do they?

DESCRIPTION:	(There’s a doorbell; everyone startles.)

	 SoundFX: “Doorbell”

RANDOM:	That leaves only one person.

SAMANTHA:	(from outside) Pizza delivery!

JEEVES:	Samantha!

DESCRIPTION:	(Jeeves opens the door and Samantha walks in carrying a wallet.)

JEEVES:	(triumphantly) Well look what we have here! Could it be Mr. Random’s wallet? Empty! What do you have to say for yourself Samantha?

SAMANTHA:	I just found it out on the toll road. The robbers must have thrown it away! I was on my way to bring it back!

	 SoundFX: “Suspense Accent”

JEEVES:	What a stroke of evil genius; delivering pizzas we didn’t order to find out who was going to be out on the road tonight with money. Brilliant! (to Blaine) Good job, Detective Blaine! You helped us solve the crime ourselves! But if Samantha was with the robbers, who was it who saved Mr. Random?

SAMANTHA:	Robbers? I’m not a robber. The police caught the robbers. They told me when I delivered three meat lovers pizzas to them an hour ago.

ALL:	(everyone gasps)

BLAINE:	Jeeves, your logic would have been perfect except I was the one who ordered the pizzas sent to the Inn!

GRACE:	You?

YVETTE:  	Is this terrible?

JEEVES:  	We don’t know yet, Yvette. Just don’t go too far from me!

SAMANTHA: 	What are you all talking about?

BLAINE:	Samantha, do you mind telling me what you did tonight?

SAMANTHA:	I was delivering pizzas all evening!

ALL:	“Oh sure!” “No way!” “Tell the truth!” etc.

BLAINE:	Anything unusual happen?

SAMANTHA:	You mean, out on the toll road? Yeah! I found that man right there who looked like he had been robbed! (to Random) Don’t you remember?

RANDOM:	Not … really.

BLAINE:	Random, Samantha is actually the person who rescued you! 

SAMANTHA:	I had so many pizzas to deliver, I couldn’t stay with him until after my shift tonight. So I brought him here and left money for medicine. I was coming back later to make sure I had left enough!

JEEVES:	You believe that? Have you lost your senses, Blaine?

BLAINE:	We’ll see right now.

DESCRIPTION: (All look around self-nervously as Ricki walks over to Random, and starts to take off a bandage.)

GRACE:	What are you doing?

BLAINE:	(looking at the bandages) Just as I thought. These aren’t regular bandages, they’re pizza napkins! You wanna read what the napkin says, Random?

RANDOM:	(reading) “Pizzapalooza Pizza Parlor, Simpleville!”

DESCRIPTION:	(Everyone’s head swings to look at Samantha.)

BLAINE:  	Samantha, can I take a look at your order book please?

DESCRIPTION:	(Samantha hands it to him.)

BLAINE:	You have your tips for the day listed here. They come to ninety-four dollars and twenty-one cents. Mr. Random, how much money did you count in that envelope in your pocket?

RANDOM:	(looks in the envelope and briefly counts. He looks up, stunned.) Ninety-four dollars and twenty-one cents.

BLAINE:	Why’d you leave almost a hundred dollars, Sam?

SAMANTHA:	’Cause that’s all I had.

RANDOM:	So that’s why I remember the pizza smell. 

GRACE:	Why didn’t you tell us?

SAMANTHA:	(smiling) You didn’t ask! I mean … it’s nothing special. Any of you would have done the same thing! Right?

DESCRIPTION:	(Those in the room start looking around awkwardly.)

DESCRIPTION:	(music begins to “Jesus Came to My Rescue”)

SAMANTHA:	I mean … Jesus rescued me! He had mercy on me! How can I not help somebody else who needs mercy? Right? … Right?

SONG: “JESUS CAME TO OUR RESCUE”

verse 1
Rich in mercy, full of love
You sent Your Son to save us
While we all were lost in sin You gave the greatest gift
The sacrifice we couldn’t give

chorus
There is mercy we don’t deserve 
There is grace we could never earn 
And hope because of what Jesus has done for us 
Let the world hear the good news 
Jesus came to our rescue 

verse 2
A sinless life He came to live 
A sacrifice He came to give 
Now all who call upon the name of Jesus shall be saved   
Our God has made a way 

chorus
There is mercy we don’t deserve 
There is grace we could never earn 
And hope because of what Jesus has done for us 
Let the world hear the good news 
Jesus came to our rescue 

scripture readers

chorus
There is mercy we don’t deserve 
There is grace we could never earn 
And hope because of what Jesus has done for us 
Let the world hear the good news 
We’re all undeserving  
But Jesus shows mercy 
Come hear the good news 
Jesus came to our rescue

SCENE 5:

ALISTAIR:	So, it seems our mystery has been solved. Or has it? Jenny Barrister is an expert in the law! Brooks Binder knows every word of the Bible, cover to imitation leather cover, in black, white and red. Why then would they both ignore an injured man and leave him in the mud? What would we do? Should we be surprised that the lowly pizza delivery girl was the only one to stop and rescue the man? And why do I keep asking questions, when I seem to already know the answers?

BLAINE:	Well, my work here is done. The robbers are in the slammer, Mr. Random is on the mend, and the toll road is safe.

YVETTE:	Simply brilliant, Detective Blaine! How did you solve the mystery?

BLAINE:	It’s the oldest trick in the book; distract someone enough with a small thing and they’ll miss the big picture! But in a way, I’d say that you all solved it yourselves. Right, Ms. Barrister?

BARRISTER:	Yes. It seems as if I fell for the old trick. I focused on the letter of the law, but completely missed the most important part: “Love God and love your neighbor.” 

BLAINE:	What about you, Binder? Any easier to read this story now?

BINDER:	I’m ready to turn the page, detective. Even though I only need to sell one more Bible this month to get a sales bonus, I’m not gonna sell this one. I think I’d better keep it; it’s about time I get to know what’s really inside those covers. I think it might change my life! 

JEEVES:	And I owe you an apology, Samantha. I’m afraid I’ve spent so much energy expecting the worst in people, I failed to even recognize my neighbor.
 
YVETTE:	That’s …

JEEVES:	You’re right, Yvette. That’s terrible! (this time Jeeves faints and Yvette catches him)

GRACE:	There’s still one important mystery left to solve.

ALL:	(ad libs) What’s that?

GRACE:	I call it; “The Mystery of What I’ll Serve for Dinner!”

SAMANTHA:	Well, I have five more pizzas in the car.

YVETTE:	Not Anchovy and Liver!

DESCRIPTION: (music begins to “Every Day”)

SAMANTHA:	No, sorry. All I have left are pepperoni!

RANDOM:	If my watch still worked, I’d say it was pizza time. (pulls out the envelope of money) Regardless of what time it is, I’m buying!

SONG: “EVERY DAY”

chorus
Every day, we’re gonna love the Lord our God
With our heart, soul, mind, and strength
Every day, we’re gonna love our neighbor
As we would love our self
We will live to love our God, and we’ll love to live for His name 
Every day, every day, every day 

verse 1 
It's the first (the first)
It's the greatest (yeah greatest)
It's the number one commandment (here it is)
Love the Lord your God with all your heart
And with all your soul
And with all your mind
And with all your strength
The second is this: 
Love your neighbor as yourself
There is no commandment greater than these
Mark 12:30-31

chorus
Every day, we’re gonna love the Lord our God
With our heart, soul, mind, and strength
Every day, we’re gonna love our neighbor
As we would love our self
We will live to love our God, and we’ll love to live for His name 
Every day, every day, every day 

bridge
Show kindness, show mercy 
Show the world that God is love 
We’re His hands, we’re his feet 
And the world needs to know 
The amazing love God has for all of us 

chorus
Every day, we’re gonna love the Lord our God
With our heart, soul, mind, and strength
Every day, we’re gonna love our neighbor
As we would love our self
We will live to love our God, and we’ll love to live for His name 
We will live to love our God, and we’ll love to live for His name 
Every day, every day, every day

SCENE 6:

ALISTAIR: 	Whether or not we realize it, we are all like the man left for dead in the parable of the Good Samaritan. The Bible says that we were dead in our sins. Trying to be good couldn’t save us. “Religion” couldn’t save us. But Jesus, the true Good Samaritan, came to rescue us. He was despised and rejected. He was beaten so we could be whole. He was whipped so we could be healed. Jesus paid the cost so we can live. Because Jesus has been such a good neighbor to us, we can be a good neighbor to others. You may be wondering what happened to these people after that fateful night? Jenny Barrister and Brooks Binder realized the emptiness of their attitudes and together formed a non-profit organization to patrol the highways and help those in need. Samantha moved her pizza shop to the Mountain Vista Inn, where it was wildly successful. Every day, several pizzas get mysteriously delivered to hungry people who didn’t order them. Mistake … or someone being a good neighbor? And Guy Random? He went into business selling Flashback Sets to church drama groups. Ricki Blaine is still a detective, but living fairly well on the royalties Mr. Random pays her. And me? All this good news is making me hungry! We hope you’ve enjoyed A Not So Terrible Parable, presented by Master’s Pizza … I mean, Master’s Peace Theater!

DESCRIPTION: (Alistair walks from his chair to the living room set and joins the impromptu pizza party.)

DESCRIPTION:	(music begins to “A Not So Terrible Parable Curtain Calls”)

chorus
We love because He first loved us
